# C# Real-time Movement Engine
--------------------------------------
This is a simple movement engine that I made in C#, you can use it if you want as I have no copyright associated with it.
---------------------------------------
# Features:
This includes: 
- A two dimensional movement system with real time input for WASD based control schemes
- A Basic two dimensional map editor
- A system for rebuilding the map behind the player instead of getting rid of it
- A basic character that can be replaced with any ASCII character
